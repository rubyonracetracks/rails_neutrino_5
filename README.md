# Rails Neutrino: Automatic Rails App Generator

Welcome to Rails Neutrino!  This repository automatically creates a new
high-quality Rails 5 app from scratch.  It takes just a few minutes to 
complete a task that would require many hours of grueling work to do manually.

## Usage
* Enter the command "sh main.sh" to automatically create a new Rails app,
starting from the "rails new" step.  The resulting app's name contains
a time stamp.
* Enter the command "sh short.sh" performs the same procedure as the
main.sh script does, but the resulting app's name is "tmp1".  This script
is used in the development process, because skipping the outlining process
in each chapter saves time.  However, it's better to use the main.sh script
so that the app outlines are updated in each chapter.

## Naming
A neutrino is type of subatomic particle with no electrical charge that
moves at the speed of light and interacts extremely weakly with matter
in its path.  In fact, neutrinos interact so weakly with objects in
their path that they fly through the entire diameter of the Earth unimpeded.

Similarly, Rails Neutrino creates a new app very rapidly because it
bypasses the need to manually read, open and close files, and cut and
paste text.
